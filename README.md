## Feature-Based Structure

> The project uses a feature-based architecture, where each feature (e.g., authentication, products) has its own folder containing its slice, API calls, and components. This helps keep the code organized and maintainable as the project scales.
>


## State Management with Redux Toolkit

> Redux Toolkit simplifies the state management logic and reduces boilerplate code. Each feature (e.g., auth, products) has a slice to handle its local state.
>


## Data Fetching with React Query and Axios

> React Query is used for managing server state, providing features like data caching, background updates, and pagination.
>

## Authentication Flow with Protected Routes

> The ProtectedRoutes component ensures that only authenticated users can access specific pages. If no token is found in the state, the user is redirected to the login page.
>
